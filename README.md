# Go Interpreter

This project is a interpreter written in Go for a simple language that I created. The interpreter is primarily based off the book 'Writing and Interpreter in Go' by Thorsten Ball. However, there are additional features (such as classes) that were not described in the book; all the sources that I used for this project are listed below.
