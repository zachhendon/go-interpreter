# Go Interpreter

This project is a interpreter written in Go for a simple language called Chimp that I created. The interpreter is primarily based off the book 'Writing and Interpreter in Go' by Thorsten Ball. However, there are many additional features/optimizations that I implemented; each source that I used for this project is listed below.
